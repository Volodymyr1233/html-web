        <p>
          Saxophone is my life. When I play I feel better and it helps me reduce
          my stress. <br />I have been playing the saxophone since I was 10
          years old. My saxophone is Alto Sax.<br />It is a medium size
          instrument with a curved neck and bell-shaped mouthpiece.<br />
          Most beginners start out playing this type of sax because it produces
          a mellow tone that is easy to play. <br />Professional musicians also
          use Alto Saxophones for their versatility and ability to blend in with
          other instruments.<br />
          <strong> My best song is Despacito</strong>
