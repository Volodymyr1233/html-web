        <p>
          There are many different card games but my favourite are: <br />
          <strong>Blitz:</strong> <br />
          A popular and casual/social card game, also known as "Scat",
          "Thirty-One", "Ride the Bus", and "Blitz". <br />
          By drawing and discarding a card each turn, the aim is to try to
          improve your three card hand to have the closest to 31 points in one
          suit. <br />
          <strong>Cheat: </strong> <br />Also called "I Doubt It" or "Bullsh**",
          this is a game many children have played.<br />The aim is to be the
          first to get rid of all your cards, and you can bluff about <br />what
          cards you are playing on a turn, but if you get challenged and
          <br />caught out you have to pick up the entire pile.
